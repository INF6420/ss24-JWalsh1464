        <h1><b><i>What can I do to help?</i></b></h1>  
        <br>
        <li>Pay attention to your child's hearing.  See if they turn to noise or look at you when you talk.  Look for signs of ear infections.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Talk to your child.  Look at them when they make noises.  Talk to them.  Imitate the sounds they make.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make silly faces with them.  Laugh when they do.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Teach your baby to copy actions, like peek-a-boo, clapping, blowing kisses, and waving bye-bye.  This teaches them how to take turns and use gestures.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Talk about what you do during the day.  Say things like “Mommy is washing your hair”; “You are eating peas”; and “Oh, these peas are good!”</li>
        <br>
        <li>Talk about where you go, what you do there, and who and what you see.  Say things like, “We are going to Grandma's house.  Grandma has a dog. You can pet the dog.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Teach animal sounds, like “A cow says moo.”</li>
        <br>
        <li>Sing, tell stories, or read to your child every day.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1><b><i>What do babies learn from reading?</i></b></h1>
        <br>

        <li>Books contain wonderful stories and songs that they love to hear over and over again.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Reading time is a time when they are held and loved.</li>
<br>
        <li>You tell them the names of body parts, the sounds different animals make, and that animals go to sleep too.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Every time families read, babies hear how words are used, listen to rich language, and learn new words.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The letters, words, and pictures you point to, all have meaning.</li>
        <br>
        <li>They can explore how books are the same and how they are different by tasting and touching them.</li>
        <br>
        <li>There is always something hiding behind the flap; favorite pictures are always in the same place in a book.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Listening is part of communication and language includes listening and understanding. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Things come in different colors, sizes, and shapes. </li>
        <br>    
        <li>It is fun to play with language, and explore rhythm, rhyme and humor.</li>
        <br>
        <li>When your baby does something, another thing happens; if the baby points at a picture, my mom or dad will tell them its name.</li>    
        <br>
        <li>Babies love books and one day they will love to read on their own.</li>

<h1><b><i>Does Screen Time Help Language Develop?</i></b></h1> 
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies younger than 18 months get no screen time at all. The exception to this rule is video chatting with grandparents or other family members or friends, which is considered quality time interacting with others. <i>Researchers have found that overall screen time and regularly having a TV on in the background were linked with lower language and social-emotional skills in young children.</i>
