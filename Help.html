        <h1>What can I do to help</h1>  
        <li>Pay attention to your child's hearing.  See if they turn to noise or look at you when you talk.  Look for signs of ear infections.</li>
        <li>Respond to your child.  Look at them when they make noises.  Talk to them.  Imitate the sounds they make.</li>
        <li>Make silly faces with them.  Laugh when they do.</li>
        <li>Teach your baby to copy actions, like peek-a-boo, clapping, blowing kisses, and waving bye-bye.  This teaches them how to take turns and use gestures.</li>
        <li>Talk about what you do during the day.  Say things like “Mommy is washing your hair”; “You are eating peas”; and “Oh, these peas are good!”</li>
        <li>Talk about where you go, what you do there, and who and what you see.  Say things like, “We are going to Grandma's house.  Grandma has a dog. You can pet the dog.</li>
        <li>Teach animal sounds, like “A cow says moo.”</li>
        <li>Sing, tell stories, or read to your child every day.</li>
